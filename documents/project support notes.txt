sergio in charge of the support team 
every time you aren't sure, never say "I don't know"
never verbally disagree with the client, they say 
consult them on your observations, he says - make suggestions. don't make a challenging statement. dont make him feel challenged (client)

"the client cant be right but you never disagree" 
the art of delivery is to put the client in his right mindset witht he right words 

use a pen and notepad for meetings

if you have overlap of meetings, ask onsite manager which to attend 

reach out to your direct support team for issues instead of anyone on the client site, he says 

field employee manager, SME, and sergio are important people  to contact 

DO NOT communicate via skype on client laptop 
don't email from client email to us 
dont email to yourself 
dont call support in front of client 
dont tell your client you have support 
dont download anything - because cybersecurity is very important in client scenarios 

do give your personal phone / email to client 
keep marketing email and phone number in mind s

one hour rule: work on something for an hour then reach out to support 

daily report on project - you make some kind of report

let them know about budget cuts or team expansion 

remember that you are an "expert" for the client
they can assign you to lead a team of developer 
thus you must know your previous project details 

first week: 
communication, call, expectations, timesheets, access process, 
note the client will test you in the beginning
second week: 
start 30 day summary report 

most failures are within the first 30 days apparently 

by day 30, you sent to client a 30 day summary feedback report apparently 
a list of tasks accomplishing, try to highlight the added value ... 
you are looking for client feedback 

communication at milestones and other intervals, very important 
30 days, 60 days.... first day, week 1, week 2... communicate 

remote work: task trackers are a requirement for remote 
get evidence 
coding / tickets / plans 
any feedback from client - get screenshots 
hour by hour work....? we will see

feedback from client at least once a week 

task tracker, screenshots, evidence... 

login/logout emails to client or something
