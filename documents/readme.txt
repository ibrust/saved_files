books not worth taking notes on: 
compiler dong book
network operating systems book 
postgresql rat book
qgis python programming book
prolog programming blue book 
python 9 projects book
MPI book (I'm guessing butlers notes are sufficient and you probably want to do work with the functions you learn instead)
computer systems (old butler OS book)
linux bible
C reference book I've been reading (however, the C STL book is worth taking notes on)
the you don't know JS series is generally not noteworthy apparently ... too much info I think
numerical analysis book from class
discrete structures book from class
algorithms book from class
the other algorithms book i bought
C++ STL book I have
architecture hennesy book
android programming dummies book

borderline worth / not worth taking notes on, but probably shouldn't: 
javascript patterns 
big AI book 
tiger linux book 
advanced programming in unix environment
python reference by beazley                       - maybe take some on the first part of this 
the MIT book on concepts / models 
ruby big book                                     - and maybe take some on this


of the above, the ones most worth removing from my list entirely are: 
dong compiler book (can't remove)
linux bible    <--- this would be the only one TRULY worth removing, it seems. Still a good book, though. Maybe just flip through it & find the chapters that I've never read about. read it last, after the other linux books. 
algorithms class book - eh... i probably still need to read it for the hell of it. knowledge of algorithms can't hurt. but probably could use a bettter algorithms book instead, really. 
advanced programming in unix environment, apparently - perhaps due to redundancy, size, relevance, and age. I think I'll just read it and not take notes on it, probably. 
computer systems - have already read it so it makes sense, and know most of the material... but still a good book and worth rereading probably at some point. 
prolog blue book
postgresql rat

you still might take just some critical notes you feel are worth remembering, but not full notes ... like 17% of the time take notes or something. just when something seems really worth writing down. 


most important ones on these lists above are: 
python 9 projects <-- also pay special attention to this 
C++ STL book
C reference book 
python reference book <-- pay special attention to this one, apparently 
javascript patterns 
numerical analysis book (wow)
the other algorithms book, not the class one (surprise)
...

books on the top of my reading list from the above list: 
computer systems OS book
MPI book
discrete structures book 
C reference book
prolog blue book 
tiger linux book 

_______________________________________________________
FROM ALL BOOKS: 

books I can learn the most from: 
assembly language
beazley reference
javascript rino book
c# stork book
fix your PC dummies book
unix network programming volume 1, sockets

books to prepare for fall 2020: 
javascript rino book
python beazley book
concepts of programming languages dong book
HTML5 for masterminds
C reference
butler class parallelism book
numerical analysis
i am putting prolog on the list even though it isn't on here, and C# as well. and the OO design book scored high for butlers general programming class, as did the linux tiger book. deep C secrets scored well for computer systems or whatever it is.
