notice he moves the bishop not to e3 but to g5. And he also plays f4. 
the queen comes to b6 and you go into the poison pawn...
later on there's pressure to move the king, kh1. 
Why? Because the bishop is not on e3, its on g5. 
thus one advantage of the bishop on e3 is you can play f4 and still protect the king when castling kingside. 
and notice that fast queenside attack? You can castle kingside if the player is too soon on the queenside attack, I bet. 
So this Be3 move allows you to play f3 or f4, it allows you to be more aggressive, yet still castle kingside if you need to. Doesn't it?
