1st interview - pair programming debug session. it's app... there's 5 bugs you have to try to debug them all. 
simplified version of an ecommerce app. first it wont compile. you have to make it compile. 
second problem is a multithreading issue where it should crash almost immediately when it starts. so fixing that. 
there should be another issue where there's an infinite load spinner you need to get rid of for a correct check. 

2nd interview - different developer. take that same application and implement a brand new feature. so far they have always requested the same feature: the scroll down to manually refresh the page. so you need to be able to add in a refresh spinner, and have that trigger a brand new data pull on the API request. 

lastly will be an interview with their tech lead / manager. you, your background experience, how you handle certain situations... 
greatest technical difficulty faced. 
then he's gona.... a few possibilities. 
they'll go into a what if scenario. we had to walk through some kind of ?calendar? app and talking on a high level of you'd architect a calendar application. now it may not be exactly that but it's gona be architecting some kind of design, best practices of modularity for some kind of app.
