cognito for authentication

used AWS and created lambad function / an API and have endpoints ready so you can use them with your app 
say AWS was already set up

need developer account and account of company you're working with so you can prepare your IPA and create all the app store connect requirements. You need to have all the marketing information about the app so tag it properly. it's quite bound to the marketing issue. 
you need to get the app approved, and they have lots of norms... its a process, you usually get rejected a few times. sometimes detected due to more technical stuff. has to do with the build of the API. 
you could claim you were working with a marketing person and designer and all the presentation 

process: you go to app store connect site, have credentials, from xcode you need to create the API, there's a process of creating certificates and profiles (that's probably what you didn't do it's info often not shared with everyone you could download that on your own computer, the rating, who the app is aimed to).

2 android, 2 ios, 2 device, 1 business analyst, 1 backend person working on AWS 

were you involved in the making of the app from scratch or did you join the team later? 
i started the app from scratch 
normally with apps that are trying to build their client base you want to send notifications to the app - how did you do that? you could have done it with google firebase... that's a way to set up an account externally and use those credentials. so you can set up that either in amazon - it's called... SMS - or in google. 

github and repositories - i had my own branch and would merge it with others. so you create different branches for each developer. so it's CI/CD. 
so jenkins automates testing, and it automates the releases... merging you do in repository. everyone subscribed to jenkins receives some update of the test. 
you can also use testlight - you dont need to go publish a whole app to the app store, just light deployment. testlight is an alternative to jenkins...
there's another one called app center... when you have large QA teams or just a client he wants to subscribe to the list, he'll get all the new releases. 

XCTest - there's this interface embedded in your project and you can write tests to say... instead of testing the whole app... you cannot be testing in your simulator, you cannot whole test the whole app completely, you'd be testing particular functions. 
so you can write tests that ... you'd create a fake line that would call a function and get a result. 

say you were involved in the process but not writing the tests?

say you got the stream from an external service. make sure it was coming in property, but was not involved in generating the stream. 
say you used google cloud platform. so you had live streams but you had a database of videos as well. you dont need database except for stored videos. 
AVFoundation is the video client you would use, or if you were gona read a QR code or a bar code... it basically uses the camera and the microphone. it's basically to use live use of the camera and microphone.
