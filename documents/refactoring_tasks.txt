1) for functions w/ arguments more than 2, bundle their arguments into an object 
2) ensure functions have only 1 responsibility - break up functions into smaller functions
3) group functions that share a purpose in similar files
4) turn some of the globals into singletones 
5) look over the function names and try to amend them 
6) add comments to the code
7) remove duplicate code
8) avoid flags in your functions - split them up into separate functions instead (you can do this after you've split up the function into smaller functions) 
9) avoid side effects in your functions (anything other than black box input / output). If you can't manage this than use singletons for the changed global variable
10) see if you can use javascripts high level functions (map, reduce, etc.) to replace some of the code 
11) see if you can extract conditional checks (like booleans) into a function that returns a boolean
