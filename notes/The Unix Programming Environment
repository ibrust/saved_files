control characters for the terminal: 
    ctrl+d - tells a program there's no more input 
    ctrl+g - rings a bell 
    ctrl+i - tab 
    ctrl+m - alternative to the enter key 
    ctrl+c 
    ctrl+u - line kill (discards the line of input)
    ctrl+s - suspend a processes output (not sure of the details). useful for preventing something important from going offscreen, apparently
    ctrl+q - resume a processes output (again not sure of the details)

misc UNIX terminal commands: 
    date
    who                 - who is using the computer
    who am i            - your username 
    mail                - can read mail apparently. not sure what email system is being used here. there are details if you're ever interested

you can type-ahead while a prior command is running; your input may appear interleaved with output, but the system will interpret your command correctly 
______________________________________________________
    ls -t               - list files since last modified 
    ls -l               - longer descriptions of files 
    ls -t -l            
    ls -tl              - you can combine multiple options 

    ls -u               - sort by last access time, newest first
    ls -lu              - show access time and sort by name; 
    ls -lut             - sort by and show access time; 

    ls -U               - use file creation time instead of last access time

    ls -l <filename>    - long description of a specific file 

in the output below: 
    ls -l

    total indicates the # of disk blocks the files take up (a disk block is something like 1-4kb, depends on system)
    the second # indicates how many links to the file there are
