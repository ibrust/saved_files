control characters for the terminal: 
    ctrl+d - tells a program there's no more input 
    ctrl+g - rings a bell 
    ctrl+i - tab 
    ctrl+m - alternative to the enter key 
    ctrl+c 
    ctrl+u - line kill (discards the line of input)
    ctrl+s - suspend a processes output (not sure of the details). useful for preventing something important from going offscreen, apparently
    ctrl+q - resume a processes output (again not sure of the details)


misc UNIX terminal commands: 
    date
    who                 - who is using the computer
    who am i            - your username 
    mail                - can read mail apparently. not sure what email system is being used here 
        ?                   - move to next message in mail
        ? d                 - delete current message 
        mail username       - send mail to a user 
        ctrl-d              - end viewing mail 

you can type-ahead while a prior command is running; your input may appear interleaved with output, but the system will interpret your command correctly
