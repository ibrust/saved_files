CHAPTER 1: 
-Apache is opensource and the most popular server
-Apache is a daemon process - it runs behind the scenes, providing services for other applications that communicate with it (such as a web browser)
-Apache is working over a network - so applications that communicate with Apache can be on different machines - i.e. clients.
-web browsers are the most common client, though there are also web crawlers / web robots (which index your hosted website), among others
-web servers translate requests into suitable responses. Clients send Apache server a request for a resource; Apache then provides a resource or an explanation for why the resource was unavailable
-often the resource is an HTMl webpage, but can also be an image, the result of a script that generates HTML, a java app, & other things
-Apache uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with clients
-the Apache executable is actually named "httpd", for HTTP daemon
-to improve Apache 2.0's performance on Windows, platform-specific logic was abstracted into a module. Modules are called MPMs (multiprocessing module). 
-Apache runs differently on UNIX & Windows. In Apache 1.3 on UNIX, child processes are forked to serve clients; on Windows there is no Fork function, and Apache must use Windows threads. 
-Apache 1.3 used the POSIX standard to implement threads for Windows, which did not translate perfectly & caused problems. 
-Now Apache 2.0 directly uses Windows threads, & it runs better on Windows
-Since threads are more efficient than forked processes, Apache 2.0 also added thread support for UNIX: "worker MPM" & "per child MPM" are modules that support this.
-In Apache 2.0, the prefork MPM provides continued forking functionality for backwards compatibility.
-On Windows platforms, Apache runs best on Windows NT because it allows Apache to run as a system service
-For reliability and security UNIX is still superior and preferred
-Apache is set up with configuration files, which contain directives that control its behavior. 
-Apache is highly configurable; this superior versatility is its great strength & drawback. You can configure Apache for any feature & security setting, but it is complicated and must often be done by hand. There are no perfect GUIs for it
-another strength of Apache is its modularity. A few core features are included in the apache executable, the rest are contained in modules. These can be either built into Apache or loaded dynamically. 
-Apache 2.0 took modularity a step further by removing platform-specific functionality from general MPMs
-You can choose which modules to include in Apache when building it from source. Including only necessary modules will reduce the memory footprint & simplify configuration, protecting against configuration errors
-you can also dynamically add modules after building Apache - you just install it then restart the server. There is a slight performance decrease upon startup but generally it's irrelevant
-there are many 3rd party modules developed for Apache. mod_fastcgi is one such example (speeds up cgi scripts w/ caching)

-remember HTTP is about how clients make web requests and how servers respond; and it's a stateless protocol

-the first line of an HTTP request consist of: method (operation) | resource | HTTP version. subsequent lines are an optional number of headers that further modify the request, the server will respond appropriately:
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1                                        
    Host: www.website.com                                           the host header can specify a hostname (http 1.1 requires this):

-the server gives an HTTP response in return. Here is a typical Apache server response: 
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK                                         numerous response headers follow - headers included vary with the server and the request
    Date: Mon, 09 Aug 2002 05:37:56 GMT
    
-connect to a server and send these messages typed out, and see what response you get (chapter 2 talks more about this)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

-HTTP methods include: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, DELETE, PUT, CONNECT. Some truncated examples: 
    -GET requests a resource, often a webpage:
        GET /index.html HTTP/1.0
        response: 
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Date: Mon, 09 Aug 2002 17:02:08 GMT
        Server: Apache/2.0.33 (UNIX)
        Content-Length: 1776
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
        Connection: close
        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//en">
        <html> ...

    -HEAD returns the header that would be returned by GET, including the content length, but not the body content:
        HEAD /index.html HTTP/1.0

    -POST sends information to the server; the server must be configured for how to respond, i.e. with a CGI script, etc.. the response may contain confirmation of receiving the request
        POST /cgi-bin/search.cgi HTTP/1.0
        Content-Length: 46
        query=alpha+complex&casesens=false&cmd=submit 

        response:
        HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
        ...

    -OPTIONS: returns a list of the methods supported by the server, especially relevant with WebDAV servers that support additional methods
        OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1                                              * is placeholder for the URI, used because no resource is needed
        Host: www.website.com
        response:
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        
    -TRACE: If I remember correctly this helps to trace the network connections and utilizes packets w/ limited lifespans. The author doesn't elaborate
    -DELETE: delete a resource on the server. Generally, servers other than WebDAV servers do not / should not allow DELETE
    -PUT: create or change a file on the server, similar to POST. PUT requests are idempotent. Calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.
    -CONNECT: method that allows proxy servers to switch into a tunneling mode for protocols such as SSL

-PUT is more suitable for creating or updating a specific thing on the server, POST is suitable for creating a new thing in a list of things, apparently 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

-URI: this is a text string which identifies a resource in a way the server can understand / use, typically a conventional URL (uniform resource locator) that can be understood by a browser... any URI on the server can be specified
-if the method doesn't need a resource, * is used as a placeholder
-HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1: nothing sends 0.9, but this is used as the default if no protocol is specified. 0.9 can only handle GET / POST 
-there are 3 kinds of dedicated HTTP headers: request, response, and entity headers
-request headers are sent by the client to the server
-response headers are sent from the server back to the client
-entity headers can be sent in either direction and add descriptive information about the message. They're only used in HTTP methods that have a body: PUT or POST
-examples of entity headers: Content-Length, Content-Language, Content-Encoding, Content-Type, Expired, Last-Modified
-Content-Length is required in client messages and usually in server messages (unless Transfer-Encoding is used instead)
-Expires tells browsers and proxies how long a document should remain valid for
-Last-Modified is used by clients or proxy servers to tell if they have updated information: they send a HEAD request to the server & check the Last-Modified header
-TCP/IP & UDP are network protocols used for internet; some other intranet ones are Token Ring (not compatible with ethernet) & SPX/IPX
-IPv6 includes IPSec, a new optional authentication / encryption method
-TCP provides mechanisms for establishing connections; ensuring data is in order; handling data loss, errors, & data recovery. TCP uses a handshake protocol & its own header that contains a sequence number. 
-IP is the routing / mailing address aspect
-UDP also uses IP. In contrast to TCP that uses handshaking & ensures data integrity, UDP is connectionless and less reliable - but faster
-TCP also uses ICMP (internet control message protocol); used to communicate control messages. This is a low-level protocol not found in applications typically
-TCP is responsible for splitting the message into packetes. There is a max packet size that varies throughout the network, TCP finds out what it is
-Each packet gets encapsulated with a TCP header. This header contains sequence number, source / destination ports, and a checksum for errors
-After TCP, IP adds its own header which contains the source & destination IP address, a protocol type code (identifies the packet as TCP, UDP, ICMP), & another checksum
-IPv6 may also sign the packet for authentication purposes
-If the packet is to be sent over an ethernet, then an ethernet header is added on top of all this. This also contains a source/destination, protocol type, & checksum. This redundancy is because Ethernet addressing works on a smaller level, using the network interface address, often within a LAN
-TCP requires that the destination send an ACK (acknowledged) response when it receives the message
-TCP also requires that the destination send a NAK (not acknowledged) if there was something wrong with the packet
-TCP also defines SYN (synchronization) and FIN messages. SYN messages establish connections - the destination responds with either an ACK to accept or NAK to reject the request. FIN messages terminate connections - either party can send a FIN at any time. 
-if TCP gets no ACK or NAK response to a message it sends, it will wait a bit and resend. It appears every packet typically gets an ACK response
-SYN flood: a type of DOS attack where many synchronization requests are sent to a server
-Note the TCP model encompasses everything from the data link layer to the application layer
-A more concrete example of a layer stack is just listing the protocols in order: 
	server (w/ ethernet): HTTP > TCP > IP > Ethernet
 	client (w/ dial-up): HTTP > TCP > IP > PPP (point to point protocol) > serial connection
-PPP is there to illustrate a protocol for passing data between modems
-movement between network layers occurs as follows: user asks for a web page in the browser; browser generates a request using HTTP; the request is transmitted over a TCP-initiated connection using IP to route it; it's routed to a gateway across a serial connection using PPP; IP routes it through any intermediate servers; the destination servers network interface identifies the packets sent to it via IP; the server pulls it & other packets like it off the network & the packet is processed using TCP; any enclosed HTTP requests are sent to Apache; Apache processes the requests and sends a response back to the client which again makes its way down the network layer hierarchy. 
-If we were using a UNIX mail application instead of web pages, we'd use the SMTP protocol in place of HTTP but the other layers: TCP / IP / Ethernet, etc. would remain unchanged. We only change the application layer & TCP/IP handles the rest. 
-On ethernet there are some alternatives to IP. ARP (address resolution protocol) can translate an IP address into a NIC address; SPX/IPX do not use IP. But IP rules the internet, which is why TCP and UDP are inseparable from IP. 
-An IPv6 address is 128 bits (in contrast with the 32 bit IPv4). it is notated with hex: fe80::910:a4ff:aefe:9a8 <-- not all the hex digits are here. the :: is a placeholder for a string of 0's that pads the number
-IPv6 addresses are partially fixed, derived from the NIC address. This allows IPv6 addresses to be allocated more automatically, & helps make devices more mobile (not explained why). 
-gateway: a point of contact between a local network & the internet which routes packets between them
-In IPv4 there are classes of networks: 
	-class A network: first number in the address is from 1-126; only first number is fixed, network supports 16,777,214 hosts
	-class B network: first number from 128-191; both first & second numbers are fixed, network supports 65,534 hosts
	-class C network: first number from 192-223; first 3 numbers in address are fixed, network supports 254 hosts
	-first number from 224-254 is reserved in the TCP/IP specification (no further details)
-IPv6 is divided similarly, but across a wider range; 48 bits are fixed, the remaining 80 assigned to a local network
-In IPv4 within a local network, all 255s in the non-fixed fields is a broadcast IP (sends the message to all IPs), and all 0's in the non-fixed fields is the anonymous source IP. netmasks can also be used to divide the IP into separate networks; hosts on these new networks must then use routers & gateways to communicate. 
-broadcast IPs are always sent with UDP because there is no established two-way TCP connection
-IPv6 does not support broadcasting, it has something else called multicasting (no further information given)
-there's also dedicated addresses reserved for local communication, and routers will never try to route these messages outside the local network. these are useful for testing network connections or for building intranets: 
	-class A: 10.0.0.0
	-class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0
	-class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.0

-127.0.0.1 is the localhost IP address in IPv4
-other 127 addresses are used by a variety of services (MAPS, ORDB, ORBZ, Spew) that operate DNS query servers. These services return an address in the 127 range if a given address is blacklisted. These services are used by mail servers to tell if an originating IP is blacklisted, occasionally (127 is not technically a legal range apparently)
-IP addresses are divided into a network address and local host address (i.e. fixed vs nonfixed parts). Netmasks are often used to get a specific part of the IP address
-with appropriate netmasks (255.255.255.0 for class C network) a host can easily tell whether a sending address is on your local network or outside it. The host will then know whether it can deliver its message directly, or whether it must send its message to the gateway. the gateway then has its own list of gateways. thus netmasking is part of IP packet routing. 
-all the hosts on a network are configured to have a gateway to send to. 
-well-known ports: every standard network service & protocol have well known ports associated with them. TCP defines the concepts of ports to distinguish different services, allowing servers to serve multiple types of requests simultaneously. 
-when a client sends a connection request, it specifies a port number along with the IP information it sends
-on UNIX there's a file /etc/services that lists all the well known ports; on windows it's C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc\ 
-HTTP is port 80, HTTPS is port 443. both TCP & UDP use these ports
-On UNIX, non-privileged programs can't use ports below 1024, these ports are reserved for system services. On Windows there is no such restriction. A non-privileged user, to set up an apache server, would have to configure it to use ports above 1024
-inetd: instead of keeping multiple daemons running to deal with each different servicable well known port, UNIX uses something called inetd (internet daemon). this monitors incoming requests for ports and launches applications for them on an as needed basis. the authors referred to this as a super-server
-remember that Apache is only serving the HTTP requests. Others, such as an FTP request, are handled by inetd launching the appropriate daemons (on UNIX systems)
-Apache 1.3 had a configuration option "ServerType" that allowed it to be launched by inetd rather than run standalone, but this was extremely inefficient since requests for HTTP are so short & apache has to be launched repeatedly. This option was removed in Apache 2.0
-inetd opens up security problems because it implements services such as telnet which are insecure. many web server administrators disable it completely, as none of the services it provides are necessary for a web server. there's a newer, more secure version called xinetd, but usually people leave it turned off.
-IPv6 supports better packet prioritization (prioritizing HTTP packets over email packets, for example) and better security with IPSec (its replacment for SSL)
-some ISPs still do not support IPv6. the server must be configured to support it. Apparently you must configure Apache to support it also
-6bone: this refers to the foundational infrastructure of the IPv6 network running parallel to the IPv4 network
-you can get an IPv6 address in 3 ways: get a 6bone address from the ISP that's part of 6bone; get a production IPv6 address from an ISP with a production IPv6 top level network identifier; Use an IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel to connect a local IPv4 address to an external IPv6 address (these addresses will start with 2002, followed by the IPv4 address of the router on the local network). more information: http://www.6bone.net & how to join 6bone

-here are some UNIX tools for troubleshooting a server: ifconfig, netstat, snoop and tcpdump, ping, spray, traceroute
-ifconfig: this can display the current configuration of a network interface / change parameters of the network interface:
	$ /sbin/ifconfig -a 		<-- this command line argument will show the configuration of all network interfaces on the host 
	> ipconfig /all			    <-- this is windows equivalent of that command
-local loopback in the ifconfig/ipconfig printout refers to the local host address. 
-in ifconfig/ipconfig you might also see multiple entries for the same device: some modern operating systems use IP aliases, which allow several IP addresses to be assigned to the same interface, producing a virtual interface (no further information). 
-man ifconfig will bring up the manual for ifconfig
-these aliased IP addresses do not have to be on the same network as the primary IP. with a netmask that evaluates the network section of the IP differently they may be kept on separate networks entirely

-netstat: another UNIX utility capable of analyzing network interfaces in detail. netstat can do a variety of things depending on the argument: 
    no argument     Display all open socket connections 
    -a              Displays all connections and listening ports.
    -b              Displays the executable involved in creating each connection or listening port. In some cases well-known executables host
                        multiple independent components, and in these cases the sequence of components involved in creating the connection
                        or listening port is displayed. In this case the executable name is in [] at the bottom, on top is the component it called,
                        and so forth until TCP/IP was reached. Note that this option can be time-consuming and will fail unless you have sufficient
                        permissions.
    -e              Displays Ethernet statistics. This may be combined with the -s option.
    -f              Displays Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) for foreign addresses.
    -n              Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
    -o              Displays the owning process ID associated with each connection.
    -p proto        Shows connections for the protocol specified by proto; proto may be any of: TCP, UDP, TCPv6, or UDPv6.  If used with the -s
                        option to display per-protocol statistics, proto may be any of: IP, IPv6, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, TCPv6, UDP, or UDPv6.
    -q              Displays all connections, listening ports, and bound nonlistening TCP ports. Bound nonlistening ports may or may not
                        be associated with an active connection.
    -r              Displays the routing table.
    -s              Displays per-protocol statistics.  By default, statistics are shown for IP, IPv6, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, TCPv6, UDP, and UDPv6;
                        the -p option may be used to specify a subset of the default.
    -t              Displays the current connection offload state.
    -x              Displays NetworkDirect connections, listeners, and shared endpoints.
    -y              Displays the TCP connection template for all connections. Cannot be combined with the other options.
    interval        Insert an integer in place of interval. Redisplays selected statistics, pausing interval seconds between each display. 
                        Press CTRL+C to stop redisplaying statistics. If omitted, netstat will print the current configuration information once.

-snoop / tcpdump / wireshark are programs that allow you to examine packets being sent on a network. snoop is for solaris systems, tcpdump is for linux, freeBSD & any other that can build it. wireshark is the python packet sniffer I tested 
-packets can be examined as they appear, and filtered according to port, source, destination, protocol, message type, & other parameters
-for example, you could monitor packets on port 80. you don't even need to be on the server, just the network - though UNIX usually requires privileged access for you to use this tool

-ping: sends out an ICMP message to a remote hostname / IP address to establish that it's present / reachable; sends back the time it took
-many versions of ping allow a remote host to be pinged at regular intervals; this is useful for preventing timing out & disconnecting from a connection

-spray & similar tools: floods a server with ping packets to test the load handling capacity of the server. the percentage of packets that are successfully processed indicate the load handling capabilities. don't use if the server is handling real traffic

-traceroute: Useful in diagnosing failed network connections (i.e. when ping fails to reach a server). It uses ICMP protocol, and gets routing information from every intermediate node in the route. 

-you can create clusters using apache and a "nameserver", & through other methods. 
-you can also set up a virtual server which runs on a cluster (details in chapter 7)
-apparently 2 popular UNIX OS's for a server are linux and FreeBSD. FreeBSD is slightly more stable & has faster networking, but Linux has more software available. He says it's mostly a minor difference and both can work for most applications, though. 

-apparently you often want to isolate a server from the surrounding intranet to avoid compatibility issues and increase security 
-typically you want the server to be dedicated exclusively to running apache: this is for performance, reliability, and limiting damage caused by crashes 

-ideally you want enough RAM for the server and any attendant processes to fit in RAM at the same time
-on UNIX: vmstat, on Windows NT: perfmon. These tools can monitor how much memory is being overrun and how much time is spent swapping pages in memory 
-CPU performance, particularly core count, is another important bottleneck 
-Frequency of access to the interface card and hard disk are 2 more important bottlenecks.  
-IMO if the application isn't doing too many writes, the speed of an M2 drive is worth the risk. Use backup hard disks to protect from disk failure. 
-RAID generally speeds up access times as well, because you have parallel access (2 parallel M2 drives is an idea)
-nowdays you probably want a 1000base card for a server regardless
-It's also important for performance that a network card has DMA capability (direct memory access, also known as "bus mastering") 
-LANs are more deanding and require greater network card speeds than typical internet connections 

-Dual Network Connections: It is very common to install 2 network cards on a server and assign them 2 different IP addresses, one for intranet and the other for internet. This way web traffic does not interfere with or bottleneck database access. 

-When considering an IP, ask the following: 
    Are they reliable? 
    Am I sharing bandwidth with many other customers? If yes, do they offer a dedicated connection? 
    If the site is international, does the ISP have good global connectivity? 
-Note: the speed of your site depends not only on your connection speed, but on how well connected the ISP is with its peers & with the internet backbone. If the ISPs connections are overloaded your connection speed won't matter. 

-Applications or third party modules with memory leaks can be a problem when running a server. Apache has a "MaxRequestsPerChild" directive which forcibly restarts Apache processes periodically, preventing unruly modules from causing too big of a problem. 

-There are a few alternatives for backup to RAID on the server: 
    DAT drives (tape) or other mass storage drives 
    network backups - saving backups on a 2nd server (you don't have to manually swap tapes in this case)
    
-if the server is compromised, the best response is usually to replace everything using backups, including the OS 
-some tools for doing network backups include: FTP, NFS, rsync, content versioning system (CVS) / git 
-NFS is generally not preferred - it compromises security. 
-rsync can be used with ssh to encrupt the backups - good if backup data is traveling across the internet 
-CVS / git works well with sourcecode and HTML files

-backups of large datasets can take considerable bandwidth. Do them during low traffic, do them incrementally, and use dual network connections if possible 

-as an alternative to setting up your own server you can buy or rent a dedicated server from the ISP. The ISP handles all the day to day maintenance, etc. 
-There are also virtual machines, etc. that you can buy, though I haven't looked into all this yet 
-disadvantages of this approach is the ISP might impose bandwidth restrictions, service quality varies, they might not do backups themselves, etc.

CHAPTER 2: APACHE BASIC INSTLALATION & CONFIGURATION
-you must choose to install from source, pre-compiled, or pre-built packages. installation can take anywhere from seconds to being very detailed
-the binary downloads on www.apache.org are pre-built. 
-the binary also comes with: all modules that can be configured externally, an installation script, a full copy of the source code, & other scripts / files 
-the binary does not (as of apache 2.0) contain automatic start / stop scripts 
-some operating systems also provide pre-built apache packages. Linux / UNIX often comes with apache pre-installed. various package installers can also install it
-there are also windows installer packages on apaches website, but these aren't binaries
-source code comes with a configuration script (called configure) that examines the system & helps determine the best way to build apache. 
-prebuilt packages might also have separate developer packages you can install, like apache-devel, that help in developing 3rd party apache modules 

-if downloading source it must be compiled, typically using cmake 
-if downloading / unzipping binary, you must go into the new apache directory and run the following command to install apache: 
    > ./install-bindist.sh {install_path}                       // choose the installation path 
-if using a windows installer, installation is generally simple. w/ custom installation you can change the install folder & start menu name, allowing you to install mulptiple apache servers
-often a new user / group will be created for apache as part of installation 

-apache can be installed manually instead of using make install or install-bindist.sh - often useful for upgrading apache, where only a few files changed
-manual installation involves creating folders to place apache executables / config files / logs, ensuring apache knows how to find them, & setting the new folder & file permissions. Read page 51 for details on manual configuration 

-generally avoid upgrading versions unless you need the new features, and avoid upgrading to a beta unless completely necessary. this avoids introducing bugs 
-if you're installing a new version of apache over an old one using install-bindist.sh, the script will copy the configuration files with .default extensions, and leave original copies of the old ones  
-often all that's required to upgrade apache is to replace the old httpd (apache executable) with the new one. 
-although this approach might work, utilities like apxs & others will probably break or partially work, so you would only really do this if you had to:
    < mv httpd httpd_old                // move the old httpd elsewhere. you can't cp over it while the server is running, but you can mv it 
    < cp new_httpd httpd                // now that the old httpd is moved you can rename the new httpd 
    < apachectl stop                    // you must stop / start the server, not restart it, for the changes to take effect  
    < apachectl start
-if you installed apache using a package manager (i.e. linux's sudo) you can upgrade it using the package managers upgrade option. sometimes large upgrades will require a little more than this, but it is generally workable 

-you need your servers clock to be correct so that various HTTP headers have the correct information. Use free "network time protocol" software to do this  
-you may also want multiple installations - for restricting user privileges, restrictive security configurations, & testing a new version. do this by either running install-bindest again, or (to save disk space) force apache to use different configuration files using its -f option 

-for a basic configuration you must decide: the server name, the network connections to listen for, where to put the log, configuration files, & web documents 
-the server name is inserted into HTTP response headers, and usually matches your domain name (i.e. www.sitename.com)
-the Listen directive tells apache to listen on a port, or optionally a specific IP address: 
    Listen 80                   // configuration directive to listen on port 80 
    Listen 192.168.1.1:80       // listen for requests to a specific, static IP address on port 80 
    Listen 127.0.0.1:80         // listen on localhost during testing 

-on Linux you can configure Apache with User or Group privileges. You run Apache with root access, but when it spawns child processes for clients they have the user/groups access privileges. This is a good way to secure apache. 
-most UNIX systmes have a special user / group called nobody for running restricted access processes. alternatively, you can configure your own user/groups: 
    User nobody 
    Group nobody 
    OR 
    < groupadd -g 999 httpd                                         // linux commands - create a group named httpd w/ group id 999 
    < useradd -u 999 -g httpd -s /bin/false -c 'web server'         // create a user w/ userid 999 in the httpd group. /bin/false means the account cant be used
    ... 
    User httpd
